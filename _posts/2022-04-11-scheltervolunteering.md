SHELTER WORKSHOPS
Sophia Dai, Melody Yu, Claire Wen
On Friday, November 12th, the Irvine
Coding Club hosted a class at the Orange
County Rescue Mission (OCRM) on
coding, Scratch, and Python. Volunteers
taught the class that was dedicated for
the underprivileged and homeless
children of Orange County. In 2 hours, we
taught the basics of Scratch and blocks
with a slides presentation and a few small
activities.
This was not the first time the ICC had
hosted classes, but it was the first time at a
homeless shelter. It was also one of our
first in-person activities post-pandemic,
and we hope to continue adding more
classes for more people. This was the start
to one of ICCs larger goals to provide
education on coding to everyone. We also
taught at the OCRM again on December 10
as well and opportunities to volunteer are
still available.
