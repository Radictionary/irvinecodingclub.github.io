The Inspire Coding Club is working together with the non profit organization Sierra Leone Rising to provide coding classes to students in Sierra Leone!  

  
This project was supported by Princess Sarah Culberson, who gave a speech to the Inspire Coding Club memembers on May 15,2022.  

ICC is grateful to our sponsor companies which donated the needed hardware and fund to facilitate remote teaching between Sierra Leone and the US. 
 
If you are passionate about teaching and helping students in Sierra Leone, you are welcome to join as a volunteer to work on this project.
